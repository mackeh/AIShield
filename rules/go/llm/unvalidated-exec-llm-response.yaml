title: Unvalidated exec.Command on LLM Response
severity: critical
confidence_that_ai_generated: 0.87
languages: [go]
category: llm
cwe_id: CWE-78
owasp_category: A03:2021 - Injection
ai_tendency: AI code examples may pass LLM-generated output directly to exec.Command for shell execution without validation.
pattern:
  all:
    - "exec.command"
  any:
    - "response"
    - "completion"
    - "content"
    - "result"
fix:
  suggestion: Never pass LLM output directly to exec.Command. Validate and sanitize all LLM responses against an allowlist of permitted commands. Use a restricted execution sandbox if dynamic command execution is required.
