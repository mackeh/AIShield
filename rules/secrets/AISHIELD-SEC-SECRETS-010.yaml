ai_tendency: AI assistants commonly generate Stripe integration code with test or live API keys hardcoded, especially sk_test_ keys that may later be swapped for live keys.
pattern:
  any:
    - "sk_live_"
    - "sk_test_"
    - "rk_live_"
    - "rk_test_"
fix:
  suggestion: Use environment variables (STRIPE_SECRET_KEY) or a secrets manager for Stripe API keys. Even test keys should not be committed to version control.
