title: Hardcoded JWT Token
severity: high
confidence_that_ai_generated: 0.75
languages: [python, javascript, go, rust, java, csharp, ruby, php, kotlin, swift]
category: secrets
cwe_id: CWE-798
owasp_category: "A07:2021 - Identification and Authentication Failures"
ai_tendency: AI code generators often embed example JWT tokens in code for demonstration purposes, which may contain sensitive claims or be valid tokens.
pattern:
  all:
    - "eyj"
    - "="
  not:
    - "decode"
    - "verify"
    - "validate"
fix:
  suggestion: Generate JWT tokens dynamically at runtime using a proper signing library. Never hardcode JWT tokens in source code as they may contain sensitive claims.
