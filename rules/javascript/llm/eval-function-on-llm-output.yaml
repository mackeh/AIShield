severity: critical
confidence_that_ai_generated: 0.86
languages: [javascript, typescript]
category: llm
cwe_id: CWE-74
owasp_category: A03:2021 - Injection
ai_tendency: AI examples may suggest using eval or new Function to dynamically execute code returned by an LLM.
pattern:
  any:
    - "eval("
    - "new function("
  all:
    - "response"
fix:
  suggestion: Never execute LLM output as code. Parse structured responses with JSON.parse and validate against a strict schema. Use sandboxed interpreters if dynamic evaluation is absolutely required.
