title: System Prompt in Client-Side Code
severity: medium

owasp_category: A01:2021 - Broken Access Control
ai_tendency: AI-generated frontend code often embeds system prompts directly in client-side JavaScript where users can inspect them.
pattern:
  any:
    - "systemprompt"
    - "system_prompt"
    - "system_message"
    - "systemmessage"
  not:
    - "process.env"
    - "import.meta.env"
fix:
  suggestion: Move system prompts to server-side code or secure environment variables. Never include system prompts in client-side bundles where they can be extracted through browser developer tools.
