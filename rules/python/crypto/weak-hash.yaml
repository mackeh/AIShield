title: AI-Suggested Weak Hash Algorithm
severity: high
confidence_that_ai_generated: 0.85
languages: [python]
category: crypto
ai_tendency: LLMs frequently suggest md5/sha1 from outdated tutorials and examples.
pattern:
  contains:
    - "hashlib.md5("
    - "hashlib.sha1("
negative_patterns:
  - "checksum"
  - "non-security"
fix:
